                            <h2> Early years on computer </h2>
                            <p> I would like to talk a bit about myself and how I managed to become a Multimedia Design Student, but also what else I do or did in my free time.</p>
                            <p> And from now, a very interesting story is coming, my home town is Corabia, a less than 15.000 people in south Romania, with no factory, no company, nothing, a dead city, were almost all the money are money from public sector. </p>
                            <p> When I was young, 5 or 6 years old, I got my first computer, a Windows 95 Pentium computer, with I guess 32Mb of RAM and 128Mb of storage, a very basic configuration, but was enought for a child to understand and learn the basics of a computer. I still remeber playing very basic games on it, but also how I broke it once because I deleted my computer from the screen, and in Windows 95 it wasn't a shortcut, it was the actual Windows file and everything, so just left click and delete on My computer, and after a restart the system wasn't there anymore. </p>
                            <p>Then, two years after I got a second pentium generation with Windows 98, and also, an internet connection. It was 2004 when I opened a browser for the first time, a very early years of google, bing, internet explorer, etc </p>
                            <p> But this time My Computer icon was a real shortcut, with no problems on deleting it. </p>
                            <p> And finally, 2006, a computer I kept for years an AMD Dual Core of 2.4 Ghz, 1Gb of RAM DDR2 667Mhz and GeForce 7300GT. A machine which served me well, but I used it on playing games most of it.</p>
                            <p> But years later, I started to use the computers for different tasks, like music mixing, editing pictures, creating illustrations. But on images, my graphic card was never strong enough, so I had to focus on sound, which required less processing power.</p>
                            <p> And this sound processing and mixing gets me to Project Synaptyc</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="flexible-content">
                            <h2> Project Synaptyc </h2>
                            <p> Being a gamer requires you to have an online nickname, I had more over the years, SlayerPro, VirusSystem, GhostNight, and others, but the last one was <strong>Synaptyc</strong> which was actually, my DJ name first. </p>
                            <p> DJ Razvan, or something close, didn't sound good, neither DJ Synaptyc sounds too good, but then I had the idea: Synaptyc Sound.</p>
                            <p> Yeah, it sounded so good, and even people liked it a lot, so I kept it, it was my dream of becoming a DJ on international stage, and it still is, but now, being at the Academy, I went from Synaptyc Sound to Synpatyc Studio, which shoul be in the end a huge company, a multimedia studio, doing media producitons, websites, music, soundtracks, videos, trailers, short-movies, porfessional pictures, articles, everything on a professional level. </p>
                            <p> This is the dream I have now, to create an entire company under the brand Synaptyc </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="flexible-content">
                            <h2> Hobbies and other activites </h2>
                            <p> Well, yet, I am still young, so I do a lot of different things, first of them would be watching TV Series, and I have a very long list up to date: <strong> Dr House, Lie to Me, Arrow, Flash, DC Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, The Originals, The Vampires Diaries, True Blood, DareDevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, Da Vinci's Demons, The Medici: Masters of Florence, Westworld </strong> and a lot of movies but the list would be too big, I will put here just some big names as: <strong> Star Wars, The Avanegers and all Marvel movies, Underworld, etc</strong> </p>
                            <p> Another passion of mine is gaming, hardcore gaming, and now I am currently playing Smite for over 3 years. </p>
                            <p>Other hobbies? I really don't know, this is basically everything I do in my free time, after school and work. </p>
