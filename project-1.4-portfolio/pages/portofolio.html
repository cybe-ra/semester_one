                                            <p> Cafe Altura was first project when I started the Academy. We just started to study, and we already got our first project in teams, made out of people from different countries. Being the first project, I would say is the project I learned the most of it, I was lucky to have a good team, and everyone wanted to create a good impression. Being the first project, we did it using method called SPRINT. We had one week to create the website, each day with a different task, a very stressful week, but also very exciting.
                                            </p>

                                                Business Model Canvas, SPRINT, colourful stickers, brainstorming, sketching, our first base of HTML and CSS, all of this are technologies we learned in our first project

                                            <p> Third assignment, being one of the very last of first semester was different, because it was the first time I had contact with php. Main focus of the class was about responsive web design also, but a little bit different, this time, because of the php, everything happened on the server, and from there, only the needed information being send to the device. </p>
                                            <p> So instead of downloading everything on your device and then the browser to chose what to show to you, in this assignment the host server detected your device trough a php script, and picked what to send to you, lowering the data consumption </p>
