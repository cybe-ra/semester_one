                            <h2> Second Project - First Individual One </h2>
                            <p> As future content creators, I had to make all the decisions a real magazine makes. What to text about, what to focus on, how should I create an article and many more things. </p>
                            <p> But it wasn't really like this, because first of all, a magazine needs readers, and to create a magazine, I had first of all to research for am I going to write and create an online magazine. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="flexible-content">
                            <h2> Research</h2>
                            <p> The research for this project was a little bit easier, because it didn't really involve looking for a company or a customer, but more likely to create surveys for people, and because of the survey, I left online on different Facebook groups, I got a lot of answers on what people whould love to read about and what they are interested into actually. </p>
                            <p> And after a few days, I closed the survey, starting to process all the answers from the survey. In the end, the magazine was a tech magazine, with accent on smartphones, laptops, gaming, software, etc. </p>
                            <p> I had the informations, now, I had to design a website based on those informations, something to fit the main theme, and yet to look like a magazine. </p>
                            <p> And after so many sketches and checking different online tech magazines, I finally made the design </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="flexible-content">
                            <h2> Keep Coding! Deadline is coming! </h2>
                            <p> After all the design process, everything left to do was the coding part, which I really enjoyed, I had to code everything by myself and because of this I learned a lot of new things.</p>
                            <p> I had to google for many features, to read about how they work and how I can create them. So overall, it was a project were I learned a lot on the development area, but I still had problems with my imaginations when it comes to the design. </p>

                            <h2> Let's not forget about Trelo </h2>
                            <p> An online platform, made to help us with time management, deadlines and task prioritising, Trelo was more like a "to do list", but it was a fast tool, where you had the options to move the tasks from a category to another, and so, in some cases, to come back to a task for different bug fixes or something similar. </p>
