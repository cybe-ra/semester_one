                            <h2> Gaming Today </h2>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                            <p> It is well known everyone loves to play a video game sometimes this days. I mean, the graphics are better and better, (unfortunately the requirements for them are also increasing year by year, and the price with them too) the internet connected everyone, and some games are specially designed for a low resource computers, so many people to be able to play them.  </p>
                                
                            <p>But, where are millions of casual players on different games, there are also the hardcore gamers, those people who play for real, at a competitive level. It may sound stupid, competitive video games, but they are very serious, these days you can even watch them online, as a live stream or so, and some people dabates if electronic games, or e-spors, should be a part of the olympics games. I am not sure what to say about that, maybe e-sports should have their own olympic.  </p>
                            <p> If you don't think this is as seriuos as it trully is, the best gamers in the world may get up to 2 million dollars for a championship. Yes, you read that number corect. 
                                Games like DoTA2, LoL, CS:GO, Smite, Warcraft, Mortal Kombat, Starcraft, are very well paid and played games, and if you ask yourself where those mnoey come from, well, from tickets to this kind of shows, from in-game money, that some people donate or use to buy items in game, and from sponsors, big tech companies like MSI, Alienware, Asus ROG, Lenovo, HP, nVidia, AMD, and so many more. They all spend momeny on this kind of championships so they could just advertise their own hardware and platform. </p>
                            <p> The most money are actually in DoTA 2 championship, which had a pool price of 60 million dollars in 2015, money which are splitted between a few hundred of teenagers.  </p>
                                <h4> Life of a gamer</h4> 
                                <p>  It may sound quite easy to just play everyday on computer and get money because of that, but it is not. Those who play for competitive level, play for over 12 hours a day, and here comes the problems, back problems, getting fat, poor eye-sight, anti-social maybe. </p>
                                
                                <p> And because of those problems, it is not something you can do for a very long time, you have to do it, to be very good, to play maybe a few years and then to stop, not to destroy yorself. 
                                Yes, it is something fast and hard, because some of them have to give up on school so they could just practice and play for hours daily. </p>
                                
                                <p> There is also the need of a personal trainer, for some sport and diets, to keep themselves fit and healty.  </p>
