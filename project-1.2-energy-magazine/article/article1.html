                            <h2> Motorola Moto G5 Plus - Review</h2>
                            <h3> Personal Review - 11 October 2017 </h3>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Today I talk about a smartphone which over the years got a new generation, with different improvemnents, android updates, a good hardware, and a good price .</p>
                            <p>When we talk about Moto G5 Plus we talk about one of the best budget phones in 2017. But before talking about the phone, let's have a word about budget phones. A budget phone, what does it mean? Is it about a cheap phone which you can use only for calls and messages? Well yes, for some people it is. Just a simple 30$ phone. But for the actual market, where the prices start at 10$ for a so called smart phone, and goes up to 1000$ for the new iPhone, or even 1500$ for a high storage capacity or Huawei Mate. So, beeing this range of prices, a budget phone is around 250 to maybe 400$, and here comes this Motorola Moto G5 Plus.</p>
                            <p> Motorola Moto G5 is the 5th generation of Moto G, a line that started when Google had Motorola, (yes, they brought Motorola a few years ago - and sold it only 2 years after to Lenovo) and it still goes one today, under the Lenovo's umbrella. What makes the Motorola devices specials? Well, the Android Updates, Motorola, with Google Nexus line, and now with Google Pixel and Nokia back on smartphone business, maybe all manufactors will try to delivery Android Updates. </p>
                            <p> Now, coming back to Motorola Moto G5 Plus - at a price tag of 300$ this phone comes with a 5.2 inch screen with a resolution of 1080p Full HD, 2Ghz Octa Core Snapdragon 625, 3Gb of RAM, 12Mpx and 5Mpx Cameras, 32Gb of Storage and Android 7.0 with the promise for upgrade to 8.0 and maybe 9.0 </p>
                                <h4> Design </h4> 
                                <p>  When it comes to design, the phone has non removable battery, a unibody construction with a front and back panel of plastic, polycarbonate, and an aluminium frame around which gives a premium feeling. The only speaker is in front of the phone, on the top, near the front face camera and proximity sensor, and on the back, we have a big canera lense that comes out, of the case a bit, with a dual tone flash. </p>
                                <h4> Performance </h4>
                                <p> With a Snapdragon 625 CPU and a Adreno 504 GPU this phone can not handle really well the latest games, but it can do a great job with most of them. The 2Ghz octa-core CPU has enought power for almost any task, being also an optimized CPU for low consumption of energy, but the Adreno 504, is not the strongest mobile GPU for intense gaming, otherwise, is a GPU that handle recording at a 4k resolution. </p>
                                <h4> Camera and speaker </h4>
                                <p> As I started before, this phone has the ability to record videos at a 4K resolution in 30fps, 1080P at 60fps or 720P with 120fps. There is no optic stabilisation for it unfortunely. Coming to photos, this camera does a very good job during the day and in good light condition, but it is quite bad in low light conditions.  </p>
                                <p> The speaker on this phone is not very loud at a full volume, it may destroy the sound at a full volume also, but because the speaker is on the front the sound will literally hit you when you just watch something on the screen. </p>
                                <h4> Screen and Battery </h4>
                                <p> Honestly, this is not the brightest screen and it may be a problem outside, in direct sun light during the hot summers days, and the lowest luminosity level is still somehow too bright during the night. Also, the color are not really that vibrant, but the resolution of 1080x1920px on a 5.2 inch screen helps it with the quality. At this resolution, luckly Motorola used a 3000Mah battery, which keeps the phone unpluged for an entire day, maybe even more, depending on your own style of using the phone.</p>
                                <h4> Software and Conclustion </h4>
                                <p> As I said before, Moto G5 Plus Comes with Android 7.0 from factory, which is a very clear Android version, with almost no edits from Motorola, just a few tricks added, and a good optimisation. And it is also a phone that comes with the promise of next version of Android, as I said earlier in this article.</p>
                                <p> As a conclusion, I recommand this phone for it's camera, long battery life, good Android experience, without lagg, and a good and fast CPU which can multi-task very well. </p>
